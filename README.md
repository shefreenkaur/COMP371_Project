# 🏨 Hotel Management System

Welcome to our Hotel Management System project! This application is built using **Java (Swing)** for the frontend, **MySQL** for the database, and follows a clean, modular architecture to manage hotel operations like room reservations, billing, and inventory tracking.

This project is a collaborative effort between three team members, each responsible for a core area of the system: **Database Design**, **Backend Logic**, and **User Interface Development**.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 Part 1: Database Design
**Assigned to: Shefreen**

This part includes:
- A comprehensive database schema covering reservations, rooms, inventory, billing, and user roles.
- MySQL scripts to set up tables, constraints, and stored procedures.
- Documentation for setting up the database and understanding its structure.

**Deliverables:**
- Schema diagrams
- SQL scripts
- Setup and usage documentation

---

### 🔹 Part 2: Backend Logic
**Assigned to: Paramvir**

This component handles all business logic and database interactions, implemented in Java.

Key features:
- Singleton database connection class
- Data Access Objects (DAOs) for modular DB operations
- Business logic for reservations, room management, inventory, and billing
- Unit testing for all backend functions

**Deliverables:**
- Java source code for backend
- JUnit test files
- Developer documentation

---

### 🔹 Part 3: User Interface Development
**Assigned to: Samardeep**

This part is responsible for building the graphical user interface using Java Swing.

Includes:
- GUI layouts for key modules like Reservations, Rooms, Inventory, and Billing
- Event handling and integration with backend logic
- User testing and feedback implementation

**Deliverables:**
- Java Swing code for UI
- Screenshots and demo videos
- User guide for navigating the system

---

## 🔗 Integration and Team Workflow

- We use **Git** for version control and smooth collaboration.
- Regular team meetings and checkpoints ensure alignment and compatibility across modules.
- Each part is designed to work independently but integrates seamlessly during final assembly.
- Clear documentation from each member helps with cross-functional understanding and final integration.
